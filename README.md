# Don't install this package

This is NOT a npm package intended for installation, for example by `npm in react-get-started`.

This is a basic setup of React with Babel, Webpack. If you don't like `create-react-app`, this probably is the way you could try.

# Get started
Go to https://github.com/ohxyz/react-get-started

1. Create a folder e.g. `my-react-project`.
2. Copy all<sup>[1]</sup> content of this repo into `my-react-project`. _Tips:_ Click the green button `Clone or download` in this page and select `Download ZIP`.
3. Go to `my-react-project`, run `npm i`.
4. Run `npm run dev`.

### Foot notes
[1] If you are not using Git, then don't copy `.gitignore`.
