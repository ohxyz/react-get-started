# React Setup

A basic setup for React project with Babel, Webpack and etc. If you don't like `create-react-app`, this probably is the way you could try.

# Get started

1. Create a folder e.g. `my-react-project`.
2. Copy all<sup>[1]</sup> content of this repo into `my-react-project`. 
3. Go to `my-react-project`, run `npm i`.
4. Run `npm run dev`.

#### Foot notes
[1] If you are not using Git, then don't copy `.gitignore`.
